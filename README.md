# Nairobi-Fare-prediction
A fare pricing model to predict cab fare prices
Nairobi Super Metro and Nissan drivers bully passengers regarding transportation fares. Each driver has their pricing, making it difficult for passengers to predict their overall cost for transportation. This model was created to use factors such as rain, time of the day, humidity, distance, temperature, clouds, wind, cab type, and destination to predict fare prices to enable passengers to know their prices and pay accordingly.
